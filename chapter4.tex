\chapter{Authenticity Proofs}\label{chap:chap4}

\section*{}
As seen in the state-of-the-art revision, most oracles as a service providers use authenticity proofs to prove their honest behaviour. However, these proofs are not infallible and the details or their implementation are not always transparent or do not provide the disclosed level of trust. In this section, I will deep dive on the most common proofs and discuss their implementation and applicability.
