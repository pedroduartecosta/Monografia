# State of the art

The topic of blockchain oracles is still unexplored territory mostly investigated by start-up companies and individuals thriving to solve a new problem. Therefore, research related to oracles may not yet be documented on peer-reviewed papers but, nonetheless, is invaluable in an early phase of the technology. Consequently, the state of the art cannot be complete without reviewing the work developed by the academia and also by start-ups, enterprises, governments and individuals. 

## Research

In terms of academic research a systematic literature review was performed. It's main components and finding are described in this section. 
A literature review allows scholars not to step on each other's shoes but to climb on each other's shoulders \cite{Kitchenham2007GuidelinesEngineering}, meaning, not duplicating existing research and find the gaps and strive to discover something new. To conduct a non-biased, methodical and reproducible review, to the extent that a human can, it is necessary to clarify and identify at the beginning of the research its methodology, what are the data sources and what is the selection criteria. 

## Research Questions
First of all and to guide the focus of the research, the following research question was defined:
- RQ1: What kind of blockchain oracles have been proposed?

## Review strategy and data sources
Figure \ref{fig:/figures/SLR_stages}, presents the predefined review strategy used in order to achieve such a goal and maintain unbiased, transparent and reproducible research.

The following 5 electronic databases were used to query for such information:
