First of all, I thank my family,

\vspace{5mm}

My father, whose values, ethic and cleverness were always a true example.

My mother, who spends her life helping kids with disabilities become educated man and woman, and whose heart knows no limit.

My brother, whose discipline, brilliance and guidance were always an inspiration.

These are also the giants in which I proudly stand upon and owe my education to.

Furthermore, I thank my supervisor Filipe Figueiredo Correia for his guidance, readiness to help and time spent meticulously reviewing this work. I also thank my second supervisor, Hugo Sereno Ferreira, for the productive and challenging discussions we had during critical brainstorming moments.
