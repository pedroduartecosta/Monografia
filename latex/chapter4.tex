%% FIXME: Problem chapter
%O capítulo sobre o problema que devia aparecer neste ponto, precisa de conter:
% - descrição geral do problema (possivelmente repetindo um pouco, mas não inteiramente, do que foi dito no capítulo da introdução) e âmbito que pretendemos atacar
% - a hipótese central subjacente ao trabalho
% - as sub-hipóteses ou research questions mais concretas
% - qual a estratégia de investigação que será usada

Smart contracts power a decentralized world of automation and trust-less commitments. Companies, groups and individuals are able to automate tasks and contracts but as far as the ecosystem is, smart contracts are still very much limited to the information available in the blockchain. Therefore, connecting with the outside world requires a trusted authority to input in the blockchain the required information upon request from the smart contract. This trusted authority is generally called an oracle.

As explained before, the deterministic nature of blockchain does not allow smart contracts to directly query a data-feed for information. In this context, oracles help connecting smart contracts to the world outside of the blockchain. The problem here is to trust in the oracle service to not behave maliciously and undermine the trust provided by the blockchain consensus mechanisms. Blockchain technology can be trusted to behave correctly even in byzantine environments, but the oracle service does not abide by the same mechanisms and therefore some mechanisms must be put in action to ensure the oracle's response credibility.

\section{Forces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Smart contract empowerment} - Providing smart contracts with trustable information from outside of the blockchain is decisive to gain general adoption and practicality.
    \item \textbf{Blockchain interoperability} - The ability to get information from other blockchains if possible using an oracle that queries one blockchain and inputs the information on another.
    \item \textbf{Keeping trust standards} - As blockchain technology creates a trust-less environment, oracles should as well keep up with the level of trust in their functioning.
\end{itemize}

\section{Proposal}

With this thesis, I intend to lay the foundations for the development and architecture of trustable oracle systems that will power several use cases and smart contracts. By describing in a trust-guided manner multiple patterns and examples where they are being applied or possible use cases not yet documented. This guided model should help future cases to have a systematic approach to which architecture will fit the best to each case.

%% FIXME: Add further explanation on the implementation
Furthermore, I will implement a possible oracle in respect to a specific architecture as to prove it's strengths and weaknesses, as well as, its applicability to solve the connectivity and oracle trust problem.
